# Our conclusions

Our analysis shows that COVID is something that affects all people regardless of political party. We’re all in this together, and political divisiveness can only hinder collaboration and recovery. The fact that the models only resolve a portion of the variance seen in the data suggests that the correlations seen may be capturing latent variation beyond what the variables directly measure, such as inequality, stress, and health disparities. These findings would suggest that in the face of future health crises, we as a nation should seek to dissolve these inequities to increase our resilience.  


.... That, and there’s not enough evidence yet.
