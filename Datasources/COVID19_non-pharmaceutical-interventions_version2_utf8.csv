The State of Alaska is developing solutions to protect the most vulnerable populations from the effects of COVID-19. These population groups include first responders and healthcare workers who need to quarantine safely without exposing their families, homeless families in congregate shelters, with at least one member who tested positive for COVID and will require isolation, and homeless individuals who require quarantine or isolation. The most viable solution to protect these groups is Non-Congregate Sheltering (NCS). In accordance with the Stafford Act, eligible emergency protective measures taken to respond to the COVID-19 emergency at the direction of state public health officials may be reimbursed, including costs for NCS for both state and local jurisdictions to protect vulnerable populations. If the need for NCS arises, the signing of COVID-19 Health Mandate 014 will allow the State of Alaska to accept FEMA assistance. FEMA assistance will be provided at the 75 percent Federal cost share.

The Governor unveiled $3.64 million in new funding to expand the state’s Farm to Family program, including $2.86 million from the USDA and $775,000 committed by philanthropy to jumpstart a $15 million campaign to further support the program through the end of the year. The Governor also highlighted critical expansions of CalFresh and EBT programs to combat food insecurity for low-income Californians, including a new Pandemic-EBT program for children who receive free or reduced lunch and EBT for online purchasing. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented level of demand at California food banks—seeing a year-over-year increase in demand of approximately 73 percent. The first three weeks of April, CalFresh saw a 140 percent increase in the number of applications over the same time last year and almost overnight, California farmers and ranchers simultaneously saw their market decrease by 50 percent. The fresh produce industry supply chain has been especially hard hit because of the perishability of the products that must be harvested, shipped and consumed in a short period of time. Nationally, the specialty crop producers estimate losses thus far at $5 billion in cancelled or reduced contracts. California accounts for at least one-half of that estimate. California’s Farm to Family program is a partnership between the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the California Association of Food Banks to facilitate food donations from farmers and ranchers by supporting food production, processing and distribution of the food supply chain. CDFA received approval from the USDA to redirect $2 million in unused Specialty Crop Block Grant funds to the California Association of Food Banks to offset the costs of picking, packing and transporting donated produce. An additional $861,854 from the USDA Farm to Food Bank program was awarded to the California Department of Social Services (CDSS) to support the program. Farm to Family partners with 41 food banks serving all 58 counties, and handles the logistics of packaging the food and communicating with food banks.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/04/29/governor-newsom-announces-expansion-of-farm-to-family-program-and-new-initiatives-to-combat-food-insecurity/,,
