# Have places that voted for Trump in 2016 had better COVID-19 outcomes than those that voted for Clinton?

No. We found that blue states did not have worse outcomes than red states.

President Trump recently remarked:

 *"If you take the blue states out, we're at a level that I don't think anybody in the world would be at. We're really at a very low level. But some of the states, they were blue states and blue-state-managed."*

As part of NC State's Geospatial Data Mining graduate course, we fact checked President Trump’s statement by answering the question, *“did parts of the nation that voted for President Trump in 2016 have better outcomes regarding COVID-19 than areas which voted for Hillary Clinton?”* We considered three outcome metrics for COVID-19: deaths per capita, cases per capita and unemployment. We investigate if political sentiments among states and counties influenced the three COVID-19 outcomes by visually mapping and comparing to regional properties from geospatial, health and socio-economic variables.
