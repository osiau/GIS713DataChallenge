# Open data, open science

## What is "open science" & "open data"?
Open science describes the practice of carrying out scientific research in a completely transparent manner, and making the results of that research available to everyone. There are six commonly accepted pillars of open science: open data, open access, open methodology, open source, open peer review and open education. Open data is the process of releasing both raw and processed data from your experiments, enabling others to analyse it without restriction. 

## Our open approach
We as a group decided to make a commitment to open science. In order to encourage reproducibility and reusability our data (raw data and cleaning scripts), methods, graphics, and all code are on our <a href="https://github.ncsu.edu/chaedri/Data-Challenge-GIS713">GIS 713 Data Challenge</a> github repository. We presented our findings so that anyone, regardless of educational background, would be able to understand and draw their own conclusions. We hope our transparency will grant those inside and outside of the academic community the freedom to run our code for any purpose, to study how the code works and adapt it to their needs, and to make improvements to the code.
