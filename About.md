## Making decisions with Random Forest

Random Forest Regression was used to identify features that contribute most to COVID-19 cases and deaths at the county scale. Random Forest is an ensemble model that is robust and able to handle large dimensions of data. Initial analyses included Moranâ€™s I spatial autocorrelation analysis. Spatial autocorrelation was found to be significant in predicting cases, deaths, and unemployment rates. The model was trained using a 70/30 split between training and testing data, and validated with the full data set. Accuracy and error were assessed using coefficients of determination (COD) and mean absolute error (MAE). The model's high error of 0.26 and CODs within 0.55-0.63 suggest that _____.
