## Executive Summary
President Trump recently remarked:

 *"If you take the blue states out, we're at a level that I don't think anybody in the world would be at. We're really at a very low level. But some of the states, they were blue states and blue-state-managed."*
 

As part of NC State's Geospatial Data Mining graduate course, we fact checked President Trump’s statement by answering the question, “did parts of the nation that voted for President Trump in 2016 have better outcomes regarding COVID-19 than areas which voted for Hillary Clinton?”  We investigate if political sentiments among states influenced the effects of COVID-19 by visually mapping and comparing to regional properties from geospatial, health and socio-economic variables.
